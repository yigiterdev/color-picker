# Color Picker

A simple Chrome extension for developers. This extension allows us to save color codes and bookmark them. I was inspired from [here](https://github.com/phptuts/yt-svelte-color-picker-2) while doing this project. This project was made with Svelte.

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# build extension
npm run build
```

Enter this `chrome://extensions/` into your Chrome search bar and in the top-right corner, turn on developer mode. Click
on “Load unpacked extension” then select your public folder.

You're ready to go! :tada:

## TODO

- [ ] Pick color from page.
